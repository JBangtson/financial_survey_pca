# Financial Company Customer Survey Principle Component Analysis

A financial institution in Washington ðŸ’° has expressed concerns that its existing membership may not align with its corporate values. This realization led them to acknowledge a need for more understanding regarding the values of their members. To address this, they surveyed 2,421 members. Utilizing dimensionality reduction on continuous datatypes with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we're able to gain insights into different perspectives to analyze the data.

The heart of the survey was the Moral Foundations Theory of Jonathan Haidt. Members were surveyed on the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, which you should take so you understand the test. Survey respondents were scored on the five foundations as well as a single-number summary, Progressivism.

The financial institution values Localism, Sustainability, and Education. These aspects of member's values were assessed in the survey as well. Localism and Sustainability used validated scales and thus can be summarized via a single score, where higher values indicate greater support for the values. Education is summarized by the following three questions, which we do not have evidence can be combined into a single score:

    In general, public schools provide a better education than private schools.
    Public school teachers are underpaid.
    Experience is more important than education in determining success in life. These questions were evaluated on a 1 to 6 scale where 1 indicated "Strongly Disagree" and 6 indicated "Strongly Agree".

Finally, we have information on the member that can be used to understand variation in their values.
